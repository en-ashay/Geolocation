# project flow

There are the following parts :

1. Selecting and comparing the CNN feature visualizations
2 Selecting the datasets ( should start with UC Merced as it is standard and will know about resource requirement)
3. Getting the performance on individual networks ( inception,vgg etc)
4. Making an ensemble of the networks (combine them)
5. How Feature fusion works and how to combine the features of the individual network.
6. Design a meta classifier for it.
7. Prove performance of meta classifier using the visualization ( may require tuning)
